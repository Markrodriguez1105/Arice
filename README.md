Arice is an Expo-based mobile application built with React Native. This project leverages Expo's powerful features to create cross-platform applications that run on iOS, Android, and web platforms from a single codebase. It utilizes file-based routing for streamlined navigation and includes modern tools for development and testing.

## Project Overview

Arice aims to help farmers by suggesting a methods that can help them in farming. Built using Expo, React Native, and other modern technologies, it offers a seamless development experience and easy deployment.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Arice up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=18)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>=9) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.22)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device (for development)
- An Android emulator or iOS simulator (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
      This will open the Expo DevTools in your web browser. From there, you can:

   - Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to open the app.
   - Run on an Android emulator.
   - Run on an iOS simulator.
   - Run in the web browser.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Development:** Built with Expo and React Native, ensuring compatibility across iOS, Android, and web platforms.
- **File-Based Routing:** Utilizes Expo Router for intuitive and organized navigation.
- **UI Components:** Includes several UI components to enhance the user experience, such as blur effects and vector icons.
- **Asynchronous Storage:** Uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for local data persistence.
- **Supabase Integration:** Includes `@supabase/supabase-js` for backend services, allowing you to [> add your Supabase project details here, like authentication or database features].
- **Haptics:** Uses `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback.
- [> Add more key features of your application here.]

## File-Based Routing

This project uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), which enables file-based routing. This means that each file in the `app` directory corresponds to a route in your application.

- `app/index.js` or `app/index.tsx`: The root route of your application.
- `app/[routeName].js` or `app/[routeName].tsx`: Creates a route named `routeName`.
- `app/(group)/[routeName].js` or `app/(group)/[routeName].tsx`: Creates a route within a group.

Refer to the Expo Router documentation for more details on advanced routing configurations.

## Using a Fresh Project

To start with a clean slate, you can use the following command:

  **Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.

- **Issue:** Expo Go app cannot connect to the development server.

  **Solution:** Make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network. Restart the Expo development server and the Expo Go app.

- **Issue:** Errors related to native modules.

  **Solution:** Try clearing the Expo cache with `expo start -c` or rebuilding the native project with `expo prebuild --clean`.
